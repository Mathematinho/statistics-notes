# Mixed Models vs Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)

## Detailed Comparison and Guide

### Introduction

When dealing with correlated or clustered data (repeated measurements, hierarchical data, etc.), traditional regression methods that assume independence are not appropriate. Two popular approaches to handle such data are Mixed Models and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). This guide provides a comprehensive comparison to help you choose the right method.

## Statistical Foundations

### Mixed Models

Mixed models extend traditional regression by incorporating both **fixed effects** (population-level parameters) and **random effects** (cluster- or subject-specific parameters).

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
y_ij = X_ij * β + Z_ij * b_i + ε_ij
```

Where:
- `y_ij` = response for subject i at occasion j
- `X_ij` = design matrix for fixed effects
- `β` = fixed effects parameters
- `Z_ij` = design matrix for random effects  
- `b_i` = random effects for subject i (assumed ~ N(0, D))
- `ε_ij` = residual error (assumed ~ N(0, σ²))

### GEE Approach

GEE uses a **working correlation matrix** to account for within-cluster correlation while focusing on marginal means.

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
E[Y_i] = μ_i = g^(-1)(X_i * β)
Var(Y_i) = V_i = A_i^(1/2) * R_i(α) * A_i^(1/2)
```

Where:
- `g()` = link function
- `A_i` = diagonal matrix with variance functions
- `R_i(α)` = working correlation matrix
- `α` = correlation parameters

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Philosophical Approach

**Mixed Models (Conditional/Subject-Specific):**
- Models the conditional expectation given random effects
- E[Y_ij | b_i] = μ_ij
- Interpretation: "For a subject with random effect b_i, the expected response is..."

**GEE (Marginal/Population-Averaged):**
- Models the marginal expectation across all subjects
- E[Y_ij] = μ_ij  
- Interpretation: "On average across the population, the expected response is..."

### 2. Parameter Interpretation

**Example: Logistic Regression Context**

*Mixed Model:*
- OR = exp(β) = odds ratio for a specific individual
- "A one-unit increase in X increases the odds by exp(β) for the same individual"

*GEE:*
- OR = exp(β) = population-averaged odds ratio
- "A one-unit increase in X increases the odds by exp(β) on average across individuals"

**Important:** For non-linear models (logistic, Poisson), mixed model coefficients are typically larger in magnitude than GEE coefficients.

### 3. Handling Missing Data

**Mixed Models:**
- Use **Maximum Likelihood** estimation
- Valid under **Missing At Random (MAR)**
- Can use all available data points
- Appropriate when missingness depends on observed values

**GEE:**
- Typically use **Complete Case Analysis**
- Valid under **Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)**
- Requires stricter missing data assumptions
- Some extensions exist for MAR (Weighted GEE, Multiple Imputation)

### 4. Correlation Structure Specification

**Mixed Models:**
- Correlation structure is **consequence** of random effects specification
- Flexible but requires correct model specification
- Misspecification can bias results

**GEE:**
- Explicitly specify **working correlation structure**
- Common structures: Independence, Exchangeable, AR(1), Unstructured
- Robust standard errors provide valid inference even with misspecification

### 5. Computational Aspects

**Mixed Models:**
- More computationally intensive (especially for complex random effects)
- Can have convergence issues with complex models
- Require numerical integration for non-linear models

**GEE:**
- Computationally efficient
- Generally more stable convergence
- Iterative algorithm typically converges quickly

## Practical Decision Framework

### Choose Mixed Models When:

1. **Individual Predictions Needed**
   - Clinical decision making for specific patients
   - Educational interventions for specific students
   - Risk assessment for individual subjects

2. **Interest in Random Effects**
   - Studying between-subject variability
   - Identifying unusual subjects/clusters
   - Understanding heterogeneity sources

3. **Missing Data Present**
   - Longitudinal studies with dropouts
   - Data missing at random patterns
   - Want to use all available information

4. **Nested/Hierarchical Structure**
   - Students in classrooms in schools
   - Patients in hospitals in regions
   - Multiple levels of clustering

### Choose GEE When:

1. **Population-Level Inference**
   - Public health interventions
   - Policy recommendations
   - Average treatment effects

2. **Robust Analysis Desired**
   - Uncertain about correlation structure
   - Want protection against model misspecification
   - Skeptical about distributional assumptions

3. **Simple Interpretation**
   - Marginal effects easier to communicate
   - Don't need subject-specific predictions
   - Focus on average effects

4. **Complete or Nearly Complete Data**
   - Cross-sectional clustered data
   - Minimal missing data
   - MCAR assumption reasonable

## Common Misconceptions

### 1. "GEE is Always More Robust"
- **Reality:** GEE is robust to correlation misspecification but sensitive to missing data assumptions
- Mixed models can be more robust when missing data is a concern

### 2. "Mixed Models Are Always Better for Longitudinal Data"
- **Reality:** Depends on research question and data characteristics
- GEE can be preferable for population-averaged questions

### 3. "Results Should Be Similar"
- **Reality:** Can differ substantially, especially for non-linear models
- Both can be correct for their respective interpretations

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Clinical Trial

**Scenario:** Randomized trial comparing two treatments, measurements at baseline, 1 month, 3 months.

**Research Question:** "Does treatment A reduce blood pressure more than treatment B?"

**Mixed Model Approach:**
- Interpretation: Individual-specific treatment effect
- Good for: Predicting treatment response for new patients
- Handles: Patients who miss follow-up visits

**GEE Approach:**
- Interpretation: Average treatment effect in population
- Good for: Clinical guidelines and policy recommendations
- Requires: Patients with complete data

### Example 2: Educational Research

**Scenario:** Students nested in schools, examining effect of teaching method on test scores.

**Mixed Model:** 
```
Score_ij = β₀ + β₁*Method_j + b₀j + ε_ij
```
- Random intercept for schools
- Accounts for school-specific effects
- Predicts individual student performance

**GEE:**
```
E[Score_ij] = β₀ + β₁*Method_j
```
- Working correlation for students within schools
- Average effect of teaching method across schools
- Policy-relevant population effect

## Software Implementation

### R Examples

**Mixed Model (lme4 package):**
```r
library(lme4)
model <- lmer(outcome ~ treatment + time + (1|subject), data = data)
```

**GEE (geepack package):**
```r
library(geepack)
model <- geeglm(outcome ~ treatment + time, id = subject, 
                corstr = "exchangeable", data = data)
```

### Model Selection Considerations

1. **Start with exploratory analysis**
   - Examine correlation patterns
   - Assess missing data mechanisms
   - Consider research objectives

2. **Compare approaches when feasible**
   - Fit both models to same data
   - Compare estimates and interpretations
   - Consider biological/scientific plausibility

3. **Sensitivity analysis**
   - Try different correlation structures (GEE)
   - Try different random effects specifications (Mixed Models)
   - Assess robustness of conclusions

## Advanced Topics

### Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) vs GEE

For non-normal outcomes (binary, count, etc.):
- **GLMM:** Subject-specific interpretations, requires integration
- **GEE:** Population-averaged interpretations, no integration needed

### Bayesian Mixed Models
- Alternative to likelihood-based mixed models
- Can incorporate prior information
- Useful for complex hierarchical structures

### Advanced GEE Extensions
- **Weighted GEE:** For informative missing data
- **Alternating Logistic Regression:** For clustered binary data
- **Quadratic Inference Functions:** Alternative to GEE
